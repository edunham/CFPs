# CFPs

Conferences to which I as a Linux sysadmin might wish to submit talks.

# Repository Structure

My main goal in building this repository is to reduce the number of times per
year that I have to think about conference deadlines. Think of its structure
as a pretend database optimized for queries by date: I need only `grep -ri
monthname` on the first of each month, and the file paths which result will
represent all conferences with relevant dates occurring in that month. This
incidentally also facilitates carrying around other information, such as my
submissions to and talks at prior occurrences of a given conference. 

# Pull Requests

If you enjoy using this repository, that's cool! You're welcome to do whatever
you wish in your own fork. I'll accept pull requests if they: 

* Are formatted consistently with the rest of the repo
* Represent conferences which interest me
* Or add interesting tooling which includes documentation and unit tests.
